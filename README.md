## Enhancement I Software Design and Engineering

### Summary
This enhancement was focused on the design of the structure of the application. Most of the changes visible to users were in the design of
the XML files and the integration of themes throughout the application as can be seen in the following section. The colors of the theme were
also integrated into a icon for the application to make it appear more professional.
