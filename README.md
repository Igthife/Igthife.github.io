## CS-499 Capstone Project

## Code Review
For SNHU's CS-499 Capstone project:
[Original Artifact](https://github.com/Igthife/Igthife.github.io/tree/main/CS360ArtifactSamuelHemond)
.

This artifact was created for CS-360 and SNHU and is an Android app designed to help track daily weight measurements of a user and then text
 the user when their desired weight is hit. The starting state of the app had 4 pages. One for logging in, one for displaying weights and goal
 weight, one for entering a phone number, and finally one for entering goal or daily weights. All three of my enhancements were 
 completed on this artifact.

## Enhancement I Software Design and Engineering

### Summary
This enhancement was focused on the design of the structure of the application. Most of the changes visible to users were in the design of
the XML files and the integration of themes throughout the application as can be seen in the following section. The colors of the theme were
also integrated into an icon for the application to make it appear more professional. I also added a drawer in the main page or the page that 
displays the users weights. This drawer was added to hold various settings that would be accessed less often than other parts of the application
 and a screenshot of this function is located in the section below.
 
Beyond this, the remainder of this Enhancement focused on better and more comments as well as formatting of the code itself. Breaking some
 functionality into new classes to handle new activities and to produce better readable code.
